Writing about yourself seems to always be challenge but somehow I need to put something on this page. Mainly I created this site as a blog, where I could share with others.

I live in [Norwich, UK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwich) and I am working for [Red Hat](https://www.redhat.com/en) \(IBM\) as part of the [OpenStack](https://www.openstack.org) team.

Nowadays, I do code mostly in [Python](https://www.python.org/), [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) and whatever else it takes to get the things done.

As I do like to give back to the community, I am a core contributor or maintainer in few other Python based open source projects like:

* [ansible molecule](https://github.com/ansible-community/molecule) and its [plugins](https://github.com/topics/molecule-driver) - playbooks and role testing framework for Ansible which orchestrates virtualized testing resources using local or cloud providers
* [cookiecutter](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter) - create projects from templates
* [pytest-molecule](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-molecule/) - a small plugin I made that enables pytest to detect and run molecule test scenarios.
* [pytest-plus](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-plus/) - adds extra functionality to pytest
* [selinux](https://pypi.org/project/selinux/) - a small python shim library that unlocks access to system python selinux bindings.
* [testinfra](https://github.com/philpep/testinfra) - write unit tests in Python to test actual state of your servers configured by management tools
* [jira](https://github.com/pycontribs/jira) - client library and CLI for communicating with JIRA Issue Tracker
* [jenkins-job-builder](https://docs.openstack.org/infra/jenkins-job-builder/) and [python-jenkins](https://python-jenkins.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) - used to automate
* [git-review](https://docs.openstack.org/infra/git-review/) - the client that eases interaction between git and Gerrit
* [doc8](https://github.com/PyCQA/doc8) - style checker for RST

There are also few other projects which I am involved with:

* [ansible-lint](https://github.com/ansible/ansible-lint) - a project that helps you write better roles and playbooks by checking style and common usage mistakes.
* [bashate](https://github.com/openstack/bashate)
* [flake8](https://pypi.org/project/flake8)
* [pre-commit](https://pypi.org/project/pre-commit/)
* [pytest](https://pypi.org/project/pytest/)
* [pytest-cov](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-cov/)
* [pytest-html](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-html/)
* [pytest-xdist](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-xdist/)
* [tox](https://pypi.org/project/tox/)

You may also want to check the list of [tools](/posts/tools) I use and occasionally fix a bug or two in those too.

# Website timeline

* 2019-12: I decided to migrate to [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) from [GitBook](https://www.gitbook.com/) and, at least for the moment use the [hugo-theme-pure](https://github.com/xiaoheiAh/hugo-theme-pure/issues). The theme has lots of issues but most of them seem solvable.
* 2018: I move from Medium to GitBook.
* ????: I use Jekyll and Git Pages for a while.
* 2008: I opened this blog for posting articles related to software internationalization. It is likely that some of the articles are going to be specific to my native language, Romanian. During the years spend in software internationalization and localization managed to made me see software with many kinds of eyes, I still happily offer my support to those that in need of help in that area. At that time I used WordPress...
