Tools and libraries I LOVE,... most of the time,... most of them:

* pytest
* ansible
* molecule
* tox
* pip
* pbr
* pre-commit
* black
* flake8
* git-review


## Cross-platform GUI apps

* **Visual Studio Code** - we can no longer say that Microsoft is not able to provide a good IDE. Atom was good, but code is great.
* **Beyond Compare** - best ever diff tool.

### MacOS specific apps

* **iTerm** -- version 3.3 is even more awesome than ever, I really need to write about it. A primary blocker switching desktop from MacOS to Linux .
* **Textual** - IRC client. While I hate irc protocol, I need to use use it for work, which currently is 99% FOSS.
