  I was surprised to realize that a huge number of US companies are not able to generate international invoices. BTW, I'm not speaking right now about a standardized invoice format - only about an invoice that should clearly identify the parties involved, the goodies and their prices.

<p>I was surprised to realize that a huge number of US companies are not able to generate international invoices. BTW, I'm not speaking right now about a standardized invoice format - only about an invoice that should clearly identify the parties involved, the goodies and their prices.</p>
<p><a id="more"></a><a id="more-165"></a>So, what is mandatory to write on any invoice:</p>
<ul style="text-align: left">
<li><strong>Company name<&#47;strong> (not necessary the business name)<&#47;li>
<li><strong>Address<&#47;strong> including
<ul>
<li><strong>Country<&#47;strong>, yes even if you are from US !<&#47;li>
<li> <strong>State, street, number, zip code, ...<&#47;strong>.  Formatting rule: in format used in the company's country<&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul><br />
<&#47;li></p>
<li><strong>Company registration number<&#47;strong> and company <strong>VAT ID<&#47;strong>  - if you have only one, it <strong>could<&#47;strong> be enough.<&#47;li>
<li><strong>Phone&#47;fax numbers <&#47;strong>- including the international prefix - specific problem in US<&#47;li>
<li><strong>Email <&#47;strong>- optional but recommended.<&#47;li>
<li><strong>Currency <&#47;strong>used using 3-letter <a href="http:&#47;&#47;en.wikipedia.org&#47;wiki&#47;ISO_4217">ISO-4217<&#47;a> currency code (USD for US dollars). You'll be amazed how many invoices are generated without specifying the currency.<&#47;li>
<li><strong>Document title<&#47;strong> - it has to include INVOICE in it<&#47;li>
<li><strong>Document number<&#47;strong><&#47;li>
<li><strong>Date of the document<&#47;strong><&#47;li><br />
<&#47;ul><br />
The list in not complete, so if you know additional requirements please send them - I'm quite sure that there are additional requirements in many countries.</p>
<p>BTW: if you are looking for a layout for international invoices you can study <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.unece.org&#47;cefact&#47;recommendations&#47;rec06&#47;rec06_ecetrd148.pdf">this document<&#47;a>.</p>
